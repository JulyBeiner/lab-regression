# Lab | Introduction to Machine Learning and ML Workflow

## Introduction

Machine learning is an exciting and essential part of a data analyst's or data scientist's work. However, data preparation is a critical step that can take up to 90% of the project time. Therefore, mastering data cleaning, normalization, and preprocessing is crucial for developing accurate and reliable models.

In this lab, we have explored data preparation, normalization, and the implementation of various machine learning models. We completed the entire workflow from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Complete Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure and quality.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and managing outliers.
3. **Normalization and Standardization**: Preparing data for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.
4. **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating different models, including:
   - Linear Regression.
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   - Decision Trees.
   - Random Forest.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RÂ² for model comparison.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory to follow the steps. This Jupyter Notebook contains detailed instructions for each phase, along with code cells and explanations.

## Modifications and Enhancements

We experimented with different normalization and preprocessing techniques, including:
- **StandardScaler** for feature scaling based on mean and standard deviation.
- **MinMaxScaler** for scaling features to a specific range.
- Model comparisons before and after normalization to assess the impact on performance.

## Deliverables

- A completed `main.ipynb` file with responses, explanations, and model training results.

## Submission

Once you have completed the lab, add your changes to Git. Then commit and push your branch to the remote repository using the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed ML workflow with model comparisons and normalization"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
